          Who Am I

          Hey there! I'm Arhen. I rolled into coding to make myself hirable
          inspite of my physical condition. I can certainly say that I'm lucky
          to even have this path ahead of me. It's been quite a journey. I
          taught myself almost everything in life, especially when it comes to
          programming. I've got this knack for it, and have been doing it for a
          while now. I'm pretty confident that I'm great at this programming
          thing and is ready to capitalize on it.

          This is gonna be my little corner of the web! I thought of this as my
          substitute for a typical resume/CV since that can be limited and
          cumbersome at times â€“ think of it as a peek into the cool stuff I've
          been up to. Scroll through my projects, and you'll see the good the
          bad and the ugly. You'll see how far I've come as a developer.
          Hopefully I also make videos of coding tips and tutorials.

                This is a game I made based on a flash game called Blob Wars.
                It's quite crude looking but it has quite the complexity.
